# Magic Images

Modern frontend user experience can be significantly improved by minimising image load times and at times, slightly modifying the look of an image based on difference device sizes. Magic imaging is a concept that allows your responsive frontend to consume images however way required for the best user experience.

This Vue package, [vue-imager](https://github.com/moirei/vue-imager), makes this integration very easy for Vue applications.

See [Dynamic Imaging routes](/guide/routes/dynamic-imaging) for endpoint API.
